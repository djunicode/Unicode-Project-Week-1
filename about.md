# DJ Unicode Project Week

DJ Unicode Project Week is a week-long event, open for SEs and TEs of all departments, not currently in Unicode. The focus of this event is _‘celebration of learning’_ and unlike similar events the primary focus of this event will be on sustainable and maintainable development, and exploration of new domains.

The main motivation behind this was that in events like hackathon, usually the same common domains such as Web Dev, AI/ML , IoT or NLP are given for problem statements. This usually results in people getting focused on only these specific 2-3 domains, and very few explore any new ones. Along with this, the main focus of these events is usually to have a working demo of the project at the end of the duration, and hardly any attention is paid to good development practices.

The Project Week aims to be better than these, encouraging people to explore new domains, and focusing the evaluation on learning and good coding, rather than solely on the final outcome of the development.

The teams will need to submit the applications and will be judged on clearly defined selection criteria. The selected SE teams will be paired with a mentor for the week by the way stated in the selection process, whereas TE teams will not have dedicated mentors. Both of them will have access to the discord channels and resources set up for this purpose. At the end, the judging will be done on clearly stated criteria similar to the selection process, and rather than selecting top-N teams, all interesting and unique ideas will be showcased.

Another unique feature of this will be maximum openness : all documents, including selection and judging criteria, and all result documents with their fields will be made public, along with explanation of the scores. There will be very few fields that will be an exception to this, and if possible the aim is to keep all scores with their remarks to be kept open for all to see. Not only this will result in transparency in the selection and judging process and participants knowing exactly based on what they will be judged, but because of the extensive remarks this will also act as a guide to not-selected teams about where and how they can improve.

Thus, the main goals of this event are to:

- Encourage exploration of unconventional and new domains, stacks etc.
- Give equal, if not more, importance to the sustainable and maintainable coding practices explicitly.
- Have clarity and maximum transparency regarding decisions and results.
- Celebrate learning, rather than just focusing on the outcome.
- Help people make projects and learn new things.
